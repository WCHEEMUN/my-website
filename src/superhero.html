    <h1>Superhero</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>A <strong>superhero</strong> (sometimes rendered <strong>super-hero</strong> or <strong>super hero</strong>) is a type
        of heroic stock character who possesses supernatural or superhuman powers and who is dedicated to fighting crime,
        protecting the public, and usually battling supervillains. A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine
        (
        <strong>also rendered super-heroine or super heroine</strong>), although the word superhero is commonly used for
        females also. Superhero fiction is the genre of fiction that is centered on such characters, especially in American
        comic books since the 1930s.
    </p>
    <p>By most definitions, characters do not require actual superhuman powers or phenomena to be deemed superheroes.<sup>[1][2][3]</sup>        While the Dictionary.com definition of "superhero" is "a figure, especially in a comic strip or cartoon, endowed
        with superhuman powers and usually portrayed as fighting evil or crime",<sup>[4]</sup> the longstanding Merriam-Webster
        dictionary gives the definition as "a fictional hero having extraordinary or superhuman powers; also: an exceptionally
        skillful or successful person".<sup>[5]</sup> Terms such as masked crime fighters, costumed adventurers or masked
        vigilantes are sometimes used to refer to characters such as the Spirit, who may not be explicitly referred to as
        superheroes but nevertheless share similar traits.

    <h2 id="sec-1">History</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3 id="sec-1.1">Early history</h3>
    <p>The word 'superhero' dates to at least 1917.<sup>[6]</sup> Antecedents of the archetype include such folkloric heroes
        as Robin Hood, who adventured in distinctive clothing.<sup>[7]</sup> The 1903 play The Scarlet Pimpernel and its
        spinoffs popularized the idea of a masked avenger and the superhero trope of a secret identity.<sup>[7]</sup> Shortly
        afterward, masked and costumed pulp fiction characters such as Zorro (1919), The Shadow (1930) and comic strip heroes,
        such as the Phantom (1936) began appearing, as did non-costumed characters with super strength, including Patoruzú
        (1928), the comic-strip character Popeye (1929) and novelist Philip Wylie's protagonist Hugo Danner (1930).<sup>[8]</sup></p>

    <h3 id="sec-1.2">1940s</h3>
    <p>During the 1940s there were many superheroes: The Flash, Green Lantern and Blue Beetle debuted in this era. This era
        saw the debut of first known female superhero, writer-artist Fletcher Hanks's character Fantomah, an ageless ancient
        Egyptian woman in the modern day who could transform into a skull-faced creature with superpowers to fight evil;
        she debuted in Fiction House's Jungle Comics #2 (Feb. 1940), credited to the pseudonymous "Barclay Flagg".
        <sup>[14][15]</sup> The Invisible Scarlet O'Neil, a non-costumed character who fought crime and wartime saboteurs
        using the superpower of invisibility created by Russell Stamm, would debut in the eponymous syndicated newspaper
        comic strip a few months later on June 3, 1940.<sup>[16]</sup></p>

    <h2 id="sec-2">Common Traits</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Many superhero characters display the following traits:
        <ul type="square">
            <li>Extraordinary powers or abilities. Superhero powers vary widely; superhuman strength, the ability to fly, enhanced
                senses, and the projection of energy bolts are all common. Some characters like Batman, Mockingbird, the
                Phantom and the Question possess no superhuman powers but have mastered skills such as martial arts, espionage
                techniques, and applied or forensic sciences to a highly remarkable degree. Others rely on fantastical weapons
                or technology, such as Iron Man's powered armor suits, Green Lantern’s power ring, and trick arrows employed
                by Green Arrow and Hawkeye. Many characters supplement their innate superhuman powers with a special weapon
                or device (e.g. Captain America's shield, Wonder Woman's lasso and bracelets, Thor's weather manipulating
                hammer, and Wolverine's adamantium claws).
            </li>

            <li>A strong moral code, including a willingness to risk one's own safety in the service of good without expectation
                of reward. Such a code often includes a refusal or strong reluctance to kill or wield lethal weapons.</li>

            <li>A motivation, such as a sense of responsibility and guilt (e.g. Spider-Man), an altruistic calling (e.g. Wonder
                Woman), a childhood trauma or personal vendetta against criminals (e.g. Batman), or a strong belief in justice
                and humanitarian service (e.g. Superman).</li>

            <li>A distinctive costume, often used to conceal the secret identity (see Common costume features).</li>

        </ul>
